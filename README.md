RGB guessing game for front end practice
This is a simple RGB guessing game that uses all that I have learnt in front end development up till now. The game generates a random RGB value each time and presents the user with 6 options. The user can then guess the correct color. If the user guesses wrong, the selected square will fade to black. If the user guesses correctly, all squares will become the same color. 
The game employs the use of javascript event listeners to perform the majority of its tasks.
